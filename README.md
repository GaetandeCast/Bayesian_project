# Variational Refinement for Importance Sampling Using the Forward Kullback-Leibler Divergence


## Extention to the two other datasets

To obtain the results on the two unused datasets, run `extension.py`, with python 3 and the packages included in requirements.txt. This is based on the original code of the article, found at https://github.com/mlresearch/v161/blob/gh-pages/jerfel21a/jerfel21a-supp.zip.

## Experiment on a Cauchy distribution

To run the experiment on a Cauchy distribution to see the impact of the three hyper-parameters, run `tradeoff.py`, with python 3 and the packages included in requirements.txt.
